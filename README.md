# â›³ Bayesian-Golf
Jupyter notebook for probabilistic predictions (scenario analysis) of choosing the best golf club on a Par-3 Hole (inspired by [Arnold Zellner's 1999 Paper](https://ideas.repec.org/p/ags/ucbecw/198684.html)).
## Method
The notebook covers Beta, Bernoulli and Binomial Distributions, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC), Logistic Link and 0-1 Loss functions, Metrolopolis and HMC sampling.
